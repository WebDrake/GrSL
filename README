-- GrSL - the GSL random Sampling Library --

GrSL is an extension of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) that aims to
provide efficient algorithms for sequential random sampling.  It is
built with the aim of eventually being incorporated into GSL  proper,
but is not yet an official part of the GSL.

Its API is designed for close compatibility with GSL, with the aim of
minimising (or hopefully not requiring) any changes to users' code if/
when it is incorporated into the main GSL library.

The project is currently in an extremely preliminary stage.
Contributions of advice, code and feedback are all welcome.

GrSL is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or (at your
option) any later version.
