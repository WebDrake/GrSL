-- GrSL - the GSL random Sampling Library --

GrSL is an extension of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) that aims to
provide effective algorithms for efficient random sampling.

It is built with the aim of eventually being incorporated into GSL
proper, but is not yet an official part of the GSL.

GrSL is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or (at your
option) any later version.
